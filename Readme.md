# ⊗ Haskell Tic-Tac-Toe Game ⊚

I'm a Haskell beginner. Please don't hurt me if your eyes start bleeding
reading this code. Rather, explain to me what I did wrong and how to improve it.

## v0

This version contains the first code I came up with, starting with Haskell. It
wasn't made with perfection in mind. The first step was to get this to the point
where it works OK-ish.
